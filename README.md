A todo webapp written in go using [htmx](https://htmx.org)
and [tailwindcss](https://tailwindcss.com/), 
with [sqlite](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3)
on the backend.

## References
Below are some of the resources I used in creating this app:
- [Code from NerdCademy's webapp in go tutorial](https://github.com/NerdCademyDev/gophat)
  - I kind of followed the structure of his code and used it 
    as a loose reference for the code I wrote for my project
- [HTML Templating With Go](https://www.makeuseof.com/go-html-templating/)
- [How to Use Templates in Go](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-templates-in-go)
  - I used these as references for using templates in go,
    as I was not familiar with using templates.
- [Using MVC to Structure Go Web Applications](https://www.calhoun.io/using-mvc-to-structure-go-web-applications/)
  - I used this article as a loose reference for ways to
    implement the MVC architecture in Go.
